# Strategies

Congratulations! You've made it this far. Now that you're ready to start using Fusion to earn some great yields, let's look at some basic strategies you can follow as a framework for your own investment strategy. We'll break things down by complexity and relative risk, so feel free to mix and match elements according to your own level of experience, investment goals, and risk tolerance.

The strategies described here are intended only to illustrate how to use the Fusion protocol and **do not constitute financial advice**. Always do your own research and make your own decisions with regard to how you use Fusion.

There are countless strategies, and which one you choose depends on your risk tolerance and short, medium, and long-term goals. That being said, the "plug-and-play" method is detailed below. Also, take some profits along the way. Don't get too greedy.

If $SPARK is OVER the peg:

-Buy $SPARK and pair it with $ETH to provide liquidity, and stake your SPARK-FTM LP in the cemetery to earn $REACTOR rewards.
-Take your $REACTOR rewards and stake them in the Masonry to earn inflationary $SPARK rewards.
-Sell half of your earned $SPARK for $ETH, and compound it back into the SPARK-FTM LP.
-Profit!

If $SPARK is UNDER the peg:

1.Buy SPARK and exchange it for RODS. If you are LP'ing, you can break the LP to exchange $SPARK for $RODS, and use the remaining $ETH to buy $SPARK to also exchange for $RODS. Now you have a big fat bag of $RODS, and you've also helped bring $SPARK back above peg so that the Masonry can resume printing.

2.Sell $RODS for a redemption bonus once $SPARK is back over peg (above 1.1 TWAP).

3.Profit.
