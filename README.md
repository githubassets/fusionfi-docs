Welcome to fusionfi.energy, home to the first algorithmic token pegged to $ETH on the Fuse Network.

## The Big Picture

The $SPARK algorithmic token serves as the backbone of a rapidly growing ecosystem aimed towards bringing liquidity and [new use cases to the Fuse network](https://fusefi.energy).

The protocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $SPARK's supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $ETH.

Inspired by the original idea behind Basis as well as its predecessors (bDollar and soup), fusion is a multi-token protocol which consists of the following three tokens:
-Spark ($SPARK).
-Spark Shares ($RODS).
-Spark Bonds ($REACTOR).
## What differentiates $SPARK from other algorithmic tokens?
Unlike previous algorithmic tokens, $SPARK is not pegged to a stable coinâ€” it is instead pegged to $ETH. 

Why is this?

Fusion believes in the potential of Fuse network, and has chosen to align its mission to both provide value to and derive value from $ETH's future growth. 

One of the primary shortcomings of past algorithmic tokens has been a lack of use cases, leaving no good reason for somebody to want to use or hold them. In order to successfully maintain the peg in the long-run, the fusion team will maintain a focus on innovation around enhanced functionality and use cases.
