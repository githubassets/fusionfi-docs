# Farms

![The Fusion farms currently available for staking LP tokens to earn REACTOR rewards](../.gitbook/assets/Farms.png)

To incentivize healthy liquidity pools for the Fusion protocol tokens, our LP farms have been seeded with REACTOR to be distributed as rewards to LP stakers across a time period of 12 months. The total REACTOR rewards are distributed from each farm as follows:

* SPARK-ETH LP: 25% of REACTOR rewards
* REACTOR-FUSE LP: 25% of REACTOR rewards
* SPARK Single Stake: 50% of REACTOR rewards
* ~~SPARK-REACTOR LP: _Deprecated_~~

### **1. What will happen when the circulating supply equals the total supply? Will reward emissions stop?**

Yes. Once the max supply of REACTOR (59.5K) is reached, reward emissions end. This will happen in exactly one year from when the REACTOR farms started on November 25th, 2021. REACTOR will always continue to print SPARK in the Boardroom, though, as long as SPARK remains above peg.

{% hint style="danger" %}
REACTOR reward emissions for the current LP farms are scheduled to end on FIXME_DATE once the total REACTOR supply has been distributed.

### 2. Why is "at-peg" (TWAP between 1.00 and 1.01) the best time to provide liquidity?

When SPARK is pegged or close to being pegged at 10,000 SPARK to 1 ETH, it is more akin to having exposure to a single asset (single staking) than to your traditional LP'ing experience, where you would run the risk of impermanent loss if one of the tokens went up in value and the other did not.

### 3. Wait, you mean that if ETH pumps, SPARK pumps with it?

**Yes!**\
\
Let's look at an example:\
\
If ETH pumps in price, it won't "outrun" SPARK, even if nobody is buying SPARK at that time.\
\
The farm APRs will vary in terms of USD value, but the emissions won’t. This is something that wouldn't be possible with another 1:1 pegged asset like a stablecoin LP position, where the USD value is directly tied to the emissions. If ETH rises in USD value, SPARK goes with it. Similarly, if ETH falls in USD value, SPARK will be worth less in USD, **but it won’t affect the peg**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The only thing that can change the price of SPARK in terms of its ETH value (and as such, the peg) is buying and selling it.
